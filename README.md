Project 1

For the first project of the Bootcamp, we presented a project that could be used to demonstrate to a local business just what we could do for them.

In this case, we chose to provide a site that would help a restaurant in uptown Charlotte attract customers by providing information on events in the area, along with a link to Ticketmaster. The idea being - get tickets and come here before or after the event, or both! We also provide information on the calory content of our menu items - another way to differentiate from other restaurants.

In this project, we had a team of four. After dividing the responsibilities, I got the page for in-house use that provided the resource for determining the calory information. This required pulling data from an API (nutrionix.com), saving the data for each ingredient, and allowing for combining ingredients into a menu meal offering. I can take no credit for the rest of the site, but all of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the kitchen page is mine. Hope you like it!
